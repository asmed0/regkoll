# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

While this project uses React, Vite supports many popular JS frameworks. [See all the supported frameworks](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Vite project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/vite-react&template=vite-react)

_Live Example: https://vite-react-example.vercel.app_

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Vite project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):

```shell
$ vercel
```

### API Endpoint

A serverless function located in `api/check.js` checks whether a plate is owned by the police. Deploy this project to Vercel and query the endpoint:

```bash
curl https://<your-deployment>.vercel.app/api/check?plate=ABC123
```

The response is a JSON object indicating ownership.
